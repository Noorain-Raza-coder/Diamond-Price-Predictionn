# Diamond Price Prediction 👨🏻‍🔧

## Problem Statement
- Pricing diamonds accurately is a complex task that involves assessing multiple attributes, which requires domain expertise and time-intensive manual evaluation. Inconsistent pricing can lead to dissatisfaction among buyers and sellers, impacting the credibility of the diamond trade. There is a need for an automated, reliable, and scalable system that can predict diamond prices accurately based on their features, reducing dependency on manual processes and minimizing errors.

- This project addresses the challenge by building a machine learning-based web application that predicts diamond prices efficiently, reduces manual intervention, and ensures accurate and consistent valuations, benefitting both industry professionals and consumers.

## Project Description: 👨‍🏫
- The Diamond Price Prediction Web Application is an end-to-end solution designed to estimate diamond prices based on key features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and other attributes.
- Built using a robust stack of Python, Flask, and machine learning, this project automates the process of price prediction with high accuracy and efficiency.
- The application incorporates data preprocessing pipelines, feature engineering, and a machine learning model deployed via an interactive web interface.
- With seamless integration of APIs, logging, and exception handling, the application is designed for reliability, scalability, and real-world usability.
